Obs: the algorithm may not be as polished or have the best Big O notation as it could be/have, the structure came out of my mind like that.

The code has two ways of finding the determinant:

#The CalculateDet presents Big O notation of O(N!) in time complexity and it is based on the Laplace Expansion to find determinants, in this case with recursion; yeah, I know, not the best.

#The CalculateDet2 presents Big O notation of O(N^3) in time complexity, which is better, and it is based on the Gauss Elimination method to find determinants.
